### SquadSearch (CS125 group project)
In this project, we created a system that allows people to search for teammates, create groups, and find tournaments to play at. By having users create profiles with their contact and player information, we hope that this will help people interact with others who share the hobbies of playing their game and strengthen the overall community for that game. Our system will support popular esport games, such as Overwatch, PUBG, LoL or Dota 2.
